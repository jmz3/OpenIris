# OpenIris

OpenIris is an eye-tracking platform for research developed by the Ocular-Motor lab at UC Berkeley (https://omlab.berkeley.edu/). It is intended for use at high frame rates and with high precision. Its plugin-based structure allows for easy expansion to use different camera configurations, tracking, and calibration algorithms or pipelines. Examples included a binocular pupil, corneal reflections, and torsional tracking at 500 Hz using two Spinnaker FLIR cameras, simulation, and more.
