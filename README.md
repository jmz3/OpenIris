# OpenIris

OpenIris is an adaptable and user-friendly open-source framework for video-based eye-tracking by the Ocular-Motor lab at UC Berkeley (https://omlab.berkeley.edu/). It is developed in C# with modular design that allows further extension and customization through plugins for different hardware systems, tracking, and calibration pipelines. It can be remotely controlled via a network interface from other devices or programs. Eye movements can be recorded online from (up to 4) camera stream or offline post-processing recorded videos. Example plugins have been developed to track pupil, corneal reflections, and torsion to capture eye motion in 3-D. Currently implemented binocular pupil tracking pipelines can achieve frame rates of more than 500Hz.
